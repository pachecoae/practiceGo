Crosstab N Size Issues

The Problem:
The N size for the first segment was being displayed as the N size across
multiple charts, which affected Grid and Rank at the very least.

Additionally, after discussions with Kelly, it was realized that clustered bar
charts do not display the N size for each segment like they do for the Grid and
Rank charts.
